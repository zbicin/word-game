# Word-Game

(tl;dr: [DEMO](http://zbic.in/word-game/))

You'll be shown mangled words and your task is to guess what was the original word.

You have 40 seconds and for each correct answer you get points - the longer the word the more points you can earn. 
However, for each character removed you loose 1 point, so be aware not to make too much mistakes!

Are you brave enough to pick up the challenge?

[Yes I am, let's go!](http://zbic.in/word-game/)
